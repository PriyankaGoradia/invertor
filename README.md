## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to design and simulate an inverter in the Cadence environment, while also gaining familiarity with the software itself. Our specific objectives were to determine the propagation time of the inverter signal, as well as the ideal PMOS width for even pull-up and pull-down strength. Our propagation time, Tprop, was 0.16658ns. We used a parametric simulation of 7 steps to find the ideal PMOS width was 150nm. The final inverter design can be used in any future schematic that requires an inverter.
